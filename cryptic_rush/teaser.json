Ronnie “the Rocket” O’Sullivan is a living person and in my book he definitely passes the <em>“famous enough to be included?</em>” test, because he’s one of the greatest snooker players of all time. But then I am aware of snooker, and I have to accept that it’s a sport with a more limited global (or even national) reach than, say, football. So not everyone will know him. But the real issue here is having to know not only (a) who he is and what he plays, but also (b) that snooker players sometimes use a thing called a “rest” to balance their cue on (if the cue ball is in an awkward spot which they can’t comfortably reach with their cue hand) and (c) that one particular (rather rarely used) type of such “rest” is called … a SPIDER.  Sense 9 in Collins: <em>“billiards, snooker: a rest having long legs, used to raise the cue above the height of the ball”</em>. I play pool and snooker and in fact I actually own a SPIDER but even so it took me a wee while to crack it because there’s no wordplay to guide you.

In 1897, a scientist named Amos Dolbear published an article titled “The Cricket as a Thermometer” that noted the correlation between the ambient temperature and the rate at which crickets chirp. The insects’ muscles contract to produce chirping based on chemical reactions. The warmer the temperature, the easier the cricket’s muscles activate, so the chirps increase.… The formula expressed in that article became known as Dolbear’s Law. It’s surprisingly simple: To Convert Cricket Chirps to Degrees Fahrenheit: Just count the number of chirps in 14 seconds, then add 40 to get the temperature. To Convert Cricket Chirps to Degrees Celsius: Count the number of chirps in 25 seconds, divide by 3, then add 4 to get the temperature. » From <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/predict-temperature-cricket-chirps\">an article at almanac.com</a>.<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000\"> </span>",
